        For hundreds of years, pairs of people all over England have resigned to
        competing with one another in a rip-roaring, hair-raising game of wits
        and intelligence that has often been referred to by the common folk as{" "}
        <i>Cows and Bulls</i>. To begin this pencil-and-paper competition, each
        player wrote down a secret code on a piece of paper that contained four
        distinct numerical digits. Then, after a customary round of rivalrous
        chunter, each player submitted a random guess for their opponent's word.
        This guess was to be evaluated against the secret code it had attempted
        to approximate.
      </div>
      <div className={styles.paragraph}>
        Without revealing any specific digit locations, the holder of the secret
        code would respond with "There are <TeX>k</TeX> cow(s) and <TeX>b</TeX>{" "}
        bull(s)," where <TeX>k</TeX> represents the number of digits that are in
        both the guess and the secret code but the locations are not shared and{" "}
        <TeX>b</TeX> represents the number of digits that are exactly the same
        in both. Consider the following example:
        <TeX
          block
          math={String.raw`
          \begin{align*}
            \text{Secret Code}  & = 9254 \\
            \text{Player Guess} & = 4352
          \end{align*}
        `}
        />
        Here, the response would be "2 cows and 1 bull," where the bull is 5 and
        the cows are 4 and 2. Players continued to trade turns presenting
        guesses until one or both of them were able to guess their competitor's
        code. The best players of <i>Cows and Bulls</i> usually figured out the
        secret code in about 5-6 turns, as was{" "}
        <a href={bibliography.solvesnov.url} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          shown algorithmically by Alexey Slovesnov

        In the late 1960s, Mordecai Meirowitz slightly modified the rules of{" "}
        <i>Cows and Bulls</i> and rebranded it as {mastermind} before selling it
        to a plastics company for a large profit. The only differences that{" "}
        {mastermind} has from <i>Cows and Bulls</i> are that it uses 6
        differently colored pegs instead of 10 digits, and it allows for a code
        to contain multiple values that are the same. Cows are replaced with
        small white pins, and bulls with red ones. Before reading on any
        further, please play this interactive {mastermind} game a few times to
        get acquainted with the rules.

        In the development of strategies for puzzles like this, it is often
        beneficial to consider simplified versions first. For the sake of
        conciseness, let us refer to a {mastermind} game with a secret code of
        length <TeX>n</TeX> that has <TeX>k</TeX> available colors as{" "}
        <TeX math="M_{n, k}" />. The board above should be labeled as{" "}
        <TeX math={`M_{${mastermind1_wordLength}, ${mastermind1_numColors}}`} />{" "}

        Since each of the <TeX>n</TeX> positions can contain any of <TeX>k</TeX>{" "}
        colors, it is fairly straightforward to enumerate the set of all
        possible solutions. Let us call this set the <em>solution space</em>,
        and label the solution space of each <TeX math="M_{n, k}" /> as{" "}
        <TeX math="S_{n, k}." /> If we choose to represent each color as a
        digit, then we can quickly find all values in <TeX math="S_{n, k}." />{" "}
        by listing all <TeX>n</TeX>-digit integers with a base of <TeX>k.</TeX>{" "}
        Because there are <TeX>k</TeX> choices for each of the <TeX>n</TeX>{" "}
        positions, the size of this set can be found using
        <TeX
          block
